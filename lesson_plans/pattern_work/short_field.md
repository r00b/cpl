# Pattern work: Short-Field Landings

## Objective

* Master pattern work
* Master short-field
* Master go-around procedures when aiming point cannot be made

## Plan
* Fly to 50R or T74
* Fly at least 4 patterns with short-field takeoffs and landings

## Standards
* Proper takoff procedure with manufacturer's recommended flap setting and braking action
  * Proper rotation at 55kts and climb-out at V<sub>X<sub>
* Altitude TPA +/- 50ft
* Fly regular patterns
  * Normal approach
  * Downwind not too close or far from runway
  * Base and crosswind turns at the same point in the pattern
* Approach airspeed +/- 5 knots of 60kts with gust factor
* Touch down at aiming point or within 100ft of it
* Utilize aerodynamic braking, flap retraction on ground roll, and simulated heavy braking
* Execute a timely go-around with proper flap retraction if necessary
