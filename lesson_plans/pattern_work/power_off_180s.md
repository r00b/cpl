# Pattern work: Power-off 180s

## Objective

* Master management of aircraft energy
* Master engine-out procedures in the pattern
* Master judgment of proper aiming point and altitude

## Plan
* Fly to 50R or T74
* Fly at least 5 patterns that terminate with a short approach power-off 180

## Standards
* Altitude TPA +/- 50ft
* Fly regular patterns
  * Normal approach
  * Downwind not too close or far from runway
  * Base and crosswind turns at the same point in the pattern
* Approach airspeed +/- 5 knots of 60kts with gust factor
* **Land +200/-0 feet of specified touchdown point**
  * Longitudinal axis aligned with and over centerline
* Utilize aerodynamic braking, flap retraction on ground roll, and simulated heavy braking
* Execute a timely go-around with proper flap retraction if necessary
