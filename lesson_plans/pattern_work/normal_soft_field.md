# Pattern work: Normal and Soft-Field Landings

## Objective

* Master pattern work
* Master normal takeoffs and landings
* Master soft-field takeoffs and landings

## Plan
* Fly to 50R or T74
* Fly at least 8 patterns
  * 4 with normal takeoffs and landings
  * 4 with soft-field takeoffs and landings

## Standards
* Proper takoff procedure with manufacturer's recommended flap setting and braking action
  * Proper rotation at 55kts and climb-out at V<sub>X<sub>
* Altitude TPA +/- 50ft
* Fly regular patterns
  * Normal approach
  * Downwind not too close or far from runway
  * Base and crosswind turns at the same point in the pattern
* Approach airspeed 65 +/- 5 knots with gust factor
* Touch down in first 1/3 of runway
  * Avoid slamming
* Proper flare and roundout to keep excessive weight and load off brakes
* Proper aft yoke position to minimize weight on nose-wheel for soft-field landings

## Tips
* Throw out flaps in ground effect to get extra float
* Remember that V<G> is calcualted with no flaps; will get more glide with no flaps than if 10Â° are in
