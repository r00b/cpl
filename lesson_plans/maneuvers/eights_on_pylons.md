# Eights on Pylons

## Objective
* Learn and master eights on pylons
* Understand the meaning of pivotal altitude
* Pivotal altitude knots: square groundspeed and divide by 11.3

## Plan
* Calculate pivotal altitude
* Fly to SE practice area
  * Properly clear area
* Determine pivotal altitude and select appropriate pylons
* Tips
  * Ground speed goes UP, pivotal altitude goes UP
  * Ground speed goes DOWN, pivotal altitude goes DOWN
  * Pylon ahead of wing, push down
  * Pylon behind wing, pull up
  * Do not use rudder pressure to yaw the airplane and force the wing and pylon to align

## Standards
* **Bank angle not to exceed 40Â°**
* Smooth and continuous corrections
* Maintain line-of-sight with pylons
* Maintain pylon position without slips and skids
