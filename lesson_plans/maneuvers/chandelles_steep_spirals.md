# Chandelles and Steep Spirals

## Objective
* Refine and polish chandelles
* Master wind correction for steep spirals
* Master airspeed management for steep spirals

## Plan
* Fly to SE practice area
  * Locate roadway to use as a visual reference for chandelles, or a point over a nonpopulated area as a reference for steep spirals
* Pre-Maneuver Checklist
* Perform chandelles up to an altitude of at least 4500 AGL followed by a steep spiral back down
* Tips
  * **Steepen bank on downwind headings; shallow bank on upwind headings**

## Standards
* Chandelles
  * Performed at least 1500 AGL
  * Initial bank angle of 30° (**do not exceed**)
  * Coordinated, constant rate rollout from 90° point to 180° point maintaining power and constant pitch attitude
  * Complete rollout at 180° point +/0 10° just above a stall airspeed
    * Maintain that speed momentarily
* Steep spirals
  * At least 3 360° turns
  * Maintain a steep spiral **not to exceed 60° bank angle**
  * Constant radius maintained around ground reference point
  * Apply proper wind drift correction
  * Divide attention between airplane control, traffic avoidance, ground track
    * Stay coordinated
  * **Maintain specified airspeed (80kts) +/- 10 knots, roll out toward reference/specified heading +/- 10°**, discontinue maneuver **no lower than 1500 AGL**
