# Pilotage and Dead Reckoning

## Objective
* Practice dead reckoning without use of GPS or other navaids
* Practice identifying visual checkpoints
* Practice using a navlog again

## Plan
* Build a navlog for a XC flight from KAUS/KEDC to KSAT
  * Ensure navlog takes magnetic variation, deviation, and winds into account
* Select appropriate route, altitude, and checkpoints based on VFR sectional
* Navigate the first one or two legs with pilotage and dead reckoning
* Perform compass turns to a heading

## Standards
* Verify position within two nautical miles of the flight-planned route
* Arrive at en route checkpoints within three minutes of the initial or revised ETA
* Be able to provide a destination ETA
* Maintain selected altitude +/- 100 feet and heading +/- 10Â°
