# Slow Flight and Stalls

## Objective
* Become comfortable with power-on and -off stalls, especially in a solo environment
* Fluid performance of stall recovery procedures

## Plan
* Fly to the practice area at 4000ft+
* Pre-Maneuver Checklist
* Slow flight
  * Find best RPM settings for descent, cruise, and climb
* Power-off stalls
  * Throttle 1500
  * Configure the plane for landing
  * Establish a stabilized descent at approach speed (65 knots)
  * When ready:
    * Throttle idle
    * Pitch back to maintain altitude
  * Recovery:
    * Reduce AOA without pitching down
    * Throttle full
    * Carb heat off
    * Flaps immediately to 20
    * Climb at 55, flaps to 10
    * Climb at Vx and flaps to 0
    * Climb at Vy
    * Cruise configuration
* Perform power-on stalls
  * Throttle 1500
  * Configure the plane for takeoff
  * At Vr (55kts):
    * Throttle full
    * Carb heat off
    * Pitch back about 15-20° to induce stall
    * Maintain directional control with rudder
  * Recovery:
    * Reduce AOA without pitching down
    * Pitch for climb at Vx
    * Cruise configuration
* Perform accelerated stalls
  * 45° bank
  * Reduce power to idle
  * Pull back with firm elevator back pressure
  * Maintain coordination and recover at first indication
* Perform turning stalls
* Practice to first indication until comfortable, then to full break (except for accelerated stall)

## Standards
* Slow flight
  * No stall horn
  * Performed no lower than 1500AGL
  * Stabilized cruise at 55kts
  * Coordinated straight-and-level flight, turns, climbs, and descents with the aircraft configured per specifications
  * Maintain specified altitude +/- 50ft, heading +/- 10°, airspeed +5/-0 knots, angle of bank +/- 5° of specified
* No secondary stall / stall horn
* No wing drop
* No excessive pitch up or down
* No spins
* ACS standards on 9/10 of the stalls:
  * Heading +/- 10° for straight stalls
  * Bank angle < 20°, +/- 5° in a turning stall
  * 45° bank for accelerated stall
  * Altitude loss <= 200ft
  * Acknowledge buffet and horn
