# Miscellaneous notes

* Separation
  * With radar, minimum ATC separation of 3 miles for aircraft within 40 miles of the radar antenna site, and 5 miles beyond 40 miles
  * These minima may be increased or decreased in certain specific situations (i.e. CENRAP)
  * Wake turbulence
    * ATC must apply a minimum required separation behind a Super or Heavy, and small aircraft behind a 757, when aircraft are:
      * IFR
      * VFR and receiving class B/C/TRSA service
      * VFR and being radar sequenced
    * Applied to aircraft operating directly behind a super or heavy at same altitude or less than 1,000 feet below (500 feet for a 757)
      * See specific separation combinations [here](https://www.cfinotebook.net/notebook/air-traffic-control/separation-standards)
    * Also applied to parallel runways less than 2500 feet between them
      * 3 minutes behind takeoff of a super
      * 2 minutes behind takeoff of a heavy and 757
